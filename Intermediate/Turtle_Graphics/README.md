### Warning for Ubuntu or LINUX Users

When I tried running Turtle Module on my local machine through Ubuntu, I had some trouble with the tkinter module and $DISPLAY variable.
Hence, I made my Tutle graphics project via my PowerShell CLI (as I do not want to waste time setting up for Ubuntu or LINUX).
